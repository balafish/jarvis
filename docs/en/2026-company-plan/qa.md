## Q1: Positioning Difference Between Jarvis and Siraya

**Question:**
Jarvis is positioned as Siraya's Tech hub, but Siraya is also building its own Tech team. If Siraya has its own Tech team, what is Jarvis's role?

**Answer:**

Jarvis has always been an **independent Vietnamese R&D company**, with the advantage of group resource sharing and direct alignment with international markets.

| | Jarvis | Siraya |
|---|--------|--------|
| Position | Independent R&D Company | Business/Sales Agency |
| Core | Pure IT R&D | Focus on Market Expansion |
| Served To | Multiple Group Companies | Siraya Tech team serves Siraya only |
| International Alignment | Yes | Internal R&D Center only |

**Collaboration Background:**

Jarvis and Siraya belong to the same group. Initially, both lacked resources, so they complemented each other. Siraya is planning its own Tech team in 2026, but this team will be an internal R&D center under Siraya, not handling any R&D needs outside of Siraya.

**Future Model:**

When Siraya has its own team, existing Jarvis-Siraya collaborative projects will transition to an **outsourced maintenance model**, or be **transferred to Siraya's R&D team** at some point in the future.

## Q3: Organization Structure and Reporting

**Question:**
Who does the Tech Lead report to? What is the relationship with Luan?

**Answer:**

Tech Lead **reports directly to Ryan**, but is accountable to "clients". In the future, Siraya will also become an independent client.

**Luan's Role:** Requirements window, technical lead on the client side

### Organization Structure

```
Ryan (Jarvis Head)
    │
    └── Tech Lead (Strategy, Team Management)
            │
            └── Development Team

--- Dotted Line ---

Luan (Siraya / Client)
    │
    └── Requirements Window, Technical Liaison
```

## Q4: Information Flow and Communication

**Question:**
Team members expect to receive company strategy and direction directly from Jarvis management, not through indirect channels. How to improve?

**Answer:**

This presentation is meant to clearly define the direction for 2026.

The past ambiguity existed because Siraya needed R&D resources and was uncertain about the investment. This year, both shareholders have finalized future development goals, and moving forward we will develop according to the plan documents.

### Future Communication Mechanisms

| Frequency | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| Monthly | Tech Lead meeting with Ryan |
| Year-end | Ryan presents next year's plan |
| 3 times/year | Cross-border exchange meetings (End of Q1, Q3, Q4) |
| As needed | Admin coordinates meetings for consensus |

## Q5: Talent Mobility Policy

**Question:**
If a Jarvis employee wants to transfer to Siraya, what is the company's stance and handling approach?

**Answer:**

Every employee can make their own choice. For Ryan, both Jarvis and Siraya are his companies, and there is no competition between them.

The better question is: **Which company do you want to be in? What goals do you want to achieve?**

### Important Note

These two companies are **not a talent mobility channel offering choices to employees**.

If a Jarvis employee wants to transfer to Siraya, it's like:
- **Resign from Jarvis** → **Get hired by Siraya**

The reverse is also true. This is a labor market mechanism, not an internal transfer.

### Process

1. **Notify one month in advance**
2. **Clear handover plan, complete handover**

### Important Reminder

- Both companies have different cultures and evaluation methods
- **You are responsible for the results**
